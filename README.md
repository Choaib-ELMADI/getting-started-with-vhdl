# Getting Started with VHDL

VHDL stands for `Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language`, and it's a hardware description language used for designing physical, digital circuits. The word `hardware` refers to the computer hardware, and more specifically integrated circuits such as the CPU.

## VHDL Workflow:

The process of running VHDL code involves several steps:

**Synthesis:** After engineers write the code using a hardware description language, it is processed by a tool, `similar to a compiler`, to generate a synthesized circuit netlist. Netlists are made up of components and their connections. Components like resistors or transistors are listed, along with how their terminals (pins) are connected through specific signal paths called nets.

**Place and Route:** Here, the netlist is processed by a tool that maps the circuit to the physical resources of the target architecture, determining the placement of components and routing the connections between them.
