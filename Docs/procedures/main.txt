-> A procedure is a type of subprogram in VHDL that helps avoid code repetition.
-> Procedures can be declared in any declarative region, with scope limited to the architecture, package, or process where they're defined.
-> When called, a procedure behaves as if its code is inserted at the call site.
-> Procedures do not return a value like functions, but can return values through "out" or "inout" signals in the parameter list.

-> Basic syntax for creating a procedure:
    procedure <procedure_name>
        (
            signal|variable|constant <name_1> : in|out|inout <type>;
            signal|variable|constant <name_2> : in|out|inout <type>;
            ...
        ) is
        <declarations_for_use_within_the_procedure>
    begin

        <code_performed_by_the_procedure_here>

    end procedure;

-> If no "signal|variable|constant" is provided, by default they are considered "constants".
-> If no direction "in|out|inout" is specified, they are treated as "in" parameters.

-> A procedure's parameter list defines its inputs and outputs and can include signals, variables, and constants.
-> Procedures can contain wait statements, making them useful in testbenches for simulating interfaces or checking outputs from the device under test (DUT).
-> If a procedure is declared within an architecture, it cannot drive external signals since no signals exist in its scope at compile time. However, procedures declared within a process can access any signals visible to the process.
-> Procedures are often more flexible than functions in cases where external signal manipulation is required, as functions must return a value and cannot directly drive signals.
