-> Normally, we want a wire in a digital interface to have either the value '1' or '0'.
-> These two values are the only values that a bit can have.
-> But in reality, a physical digital signal can be in a number of states, which the std_logic type does a good job emulating.
-> std_logic is a resolved type, meaning that its value will be determined by a resolution function - when multiple processes try to drive this signal.

-> The std_logic type can have the following values:
    '1' ---> Logic 1
    '0' ---> Logic 0
    'Z' ---> High impedance >> not connected
    'W' ---> Weak signal, can't tell if 0 or 1
    'L' ---> Weak 0, pulldown
    'H' ---> Weak 1, pullup
    '-' ---> Don't care
    'U' ---> Uninitialized
    'X' ---> Unknown, multiple drivers >> several processes trying to write different values to a signal
