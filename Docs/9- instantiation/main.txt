-> VHDL modules:
    * Modules are the basic building blocks of VHDL designs.
    * Each module is defined by the entity and the architecture blocks.
    * The entity specifies the module's input and output ports, while the architecture describes its internal behavior or structure.
    * In VHDL, every entity must be associated with one or more architectures.

-> The port map statement connects the inputs and outputs of a module to local signals or variables in the environment (testbench) where the module is instantiated.
-> The syntax for instantiating a module in another VHDL file is:
    * Explicit Instantiation:
        <label>: entity <library_name>.<entity_name>(<architecture_name>) port map (
            <entity_signal_name> => <local_signal_name>,
            ...
        );

    * Direct Instantiation:
        <label>: <entity_name> port map (
            <entity_signal_name> => <local_signal_name>,
            ...
        );

    * Component Instantiation:
        component <entity_name>
            port (
                <port_list>
            );
        end component;

        <label>: <entity_name> port map (
            <entity_signal_name> => <local_signal_name>,
            ...
        );
