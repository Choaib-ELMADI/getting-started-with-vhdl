-> Concurrent statements:
    * A concurrent statement in VHDL is a way to assign values to signals outside of a process, directly within the architecture.
    * It runs in parallel with other operations.
    * Instead of writing a full process block with a sensitivity list, you can just write the signal assignment directly.
